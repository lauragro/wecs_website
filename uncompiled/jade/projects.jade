    h2#wecs-meetings WECS Meetings

    p
      | We plan events ranging from interactive workshops to general planning meetings to watching movies and going on walks. As always, everyone is welcome. Most recently we ran a 3D printing workshop where students learned about the applications of the 3D printer and it's uses on campus.
      | Our next meeting is Wednesday October 9th @3:30 (meet in the ECS Lobby).

    h2#speaker Speaker Series

    p
      | One of the goals of WECS is to invite speakers to address the students of
      | the University of Victoria and share their experiences. Typically we try to find
      | speakers who are female and work in areas interesting to engineering and
      | computer science students. Regardless, these are open events and all members
      | of the community are encouraged to participate. Tea and cookies are
      | provided at every speaker event but we ask that you ing your own mug in an
      | effort to reduce waste.

    h2#community Community Workshop Program

    p
      | During the Spring of 2013 WECS created an outreach program aimed at girls ages 5-9.
      | We took our program to local Girl Guide groups and taught participants about Computer
      | Science and Engineering. Through team based activities the girls learned interesting
      | facts about how a computer works as well as how to plan and execute building a simple
      | structure. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the participants parents
      | and guide leaders, and we look forward to continuing this program in the following years.

      | "CSC Revealed" is the WECS based clinic series aimed at providing additional
      | support to students taking first year introductory Computer Science courses at the University
      | of Victoria. Graduate and senior undergraduate students lead interactive sessions where students are
      | guided through examples tailored to what they are currently learning in class. These events also encourage
      | mentorship between students.
