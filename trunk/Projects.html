                <h3><a id="WECS_Meetings">WECS Meetings</a></h3>
                <p>General planning meetings, sometimes more of a networking event and we put
                on a video of a talk that is relevant to our members. As always everyone is welcome.
                <b><br>Next Meeting: TBA (stay tuned for updates in early September!)</br></b></p>
                <br>

                <h3> <a id="Speaker">Speaker Series</a></h3>
                <p>One of the goals of WECS is to invite speakers to address the students of
                the University of Victoria and share their experiences. Typically we try to find
                speakers who are female and work in areas interesting to engineering and
                computer science students. Regardless, these are open events and all members
                of the community are encouraged to participate. Coffee, tea and cookies are
                provided at every speaker event but we ask that you bring your own mug in an
                effort to reduce waste.</p>
                <b>Some notable speakers :</b>

                <h3><a id="Community">Community Workshop Program</a></h3>
                <p>During the Spring of 2013 WECS created an outreach program aimed at girls ages 5-9.
                We took our program to local Girl Guide groups and taught participants about Computer
                Science and Engineering. Through team based activities the girls learned interesting
                facts about how a computer works as well as how to plan and execute building a simple
                structure. We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the participants parents
                and guide leaders, and we look forward to continuing this program in the following years.</p>

                <h3><a id="Programming">Programming Clinics</a></h3>
                <p>"CSC Revealed" is the WECS based clinic series aimed at providing additional
                support to students taking first year introductory Computer Science courses at the University
                of Victoria. Graduate and senior undergraduate students lead interactive sessions where students are
                guided through examples tailored to what they are currently learning in class. These events also encourage
                mentorship between students.</p>

                <p>Representatives from the Microsoft team from the Victoria office came in with
                engineers who had previously graduated from UVic. Their hiring manager provided a brief

                provided individual feedback to all interested participants.</p>
